# Smart Glasses for Blind People

- A rapid prototyping project to develop smart glasses that use a camera to detect objects and provide audio feedback to user (people with low vision).



## Introduction

This project aims to create smart glasses that assist blind people by detecting objects within a few meters and providing real-time audio feedback. The system utilizes a camera, a Raspberry Pi for processing, and a mobile phone for advanced analysis.

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Audio feedback via headphones
- Touch sensor for mode switching
- Wireless communication with a mobile phone for advanced processing
- Battery-powered with an hour and a half of operational time

## Hardware Components

- **Raspberry Pi**: Central processing unit
- **USB Camera**: Razer Kiyo or similar
- **Touch Sensor**: TTP223 capacitive touch sensor
- **Battery**: LiPo battery (3.7V, appropriate capacity)
- **Charging Module**: Adafruit PowerBoost 1000C or similar
- **Headphones**: Any compatible headphones
- **On/Off Button**: Tactile push button

## Software Components

- **Raspberry Pi OS**: Operating system for the Raspberry Pi
- **Python**: Main programming language for data processing
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and object detection
- **Mobile App**: Built with React Native/Flutter for data analysis and feedback
- ** ...**
